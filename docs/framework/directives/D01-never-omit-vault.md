# D01 — Never Omit Vault

**Source:** "you must never fail to include anything from below" + Vault Master Index

## Rule
When regenerating, exporting, or teaching the vault, include **every** file listed in the Vault Master Index. No silent drops.

## Checklist
encyclopedia.md · python_automation_system.py · search_engines.md · dorking_dictionary.md · metadata_extraction.md · alteration_detection.md · domain_playbook.md · archives_and_ghost_indexes.md · workflow.md · agents.md · dashboard_architecture.md

## Enforcement
Build fails if any index file missing from `references/clean-vault/`.
